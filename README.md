👋 Hi, I’m @Cheyenne1997 
I am interested in sharing my creations with the world whilst selflessly being alturstic, sharing my creations for all to enjoy. 
The more we learn, the more better become.

👀 I’m interested in ...
Reverse Engineering, Microsoft Auto Assembly, Kernel Drivers, C++, SQL, Visual Studio, Debugging, Virtual Machines, Game Modification as well as a lot of other things!

 
🌱 I’m currently learning ... a tiny fraction of it all. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... just about anything!
